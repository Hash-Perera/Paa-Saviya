                Ms. Dissanayka played a pivotal role in providing 50 pairs of
                diabetic footwear during the Colombo Diabetic Foot Conference,
                held on February 1, 2022, at the National Hospital of Sri Lanka.

                at enhancing diabetic foot care. We deeply appreciate her
                commitment to our cause and her dedication to improving patient
                outcomes.
